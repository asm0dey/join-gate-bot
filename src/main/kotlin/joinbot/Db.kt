/**
 * Registers the existing pool with Exposed's transaction manager. Exposed never opens
 * its own connections — every query still goes through the Hikari pool Flyway used.
 *
 * Memoized one `Database` per `DataSource`: Exposed's `TransactionManager` keeps a
 * static registry keyed by `Database`, and nothing in this codebase ever calls
 * `closeAndUnregister`, so calling `Database.connect` again for the same pool would
 * permanently pin a second registration for the JVM's lifetime. Callers still must
 * pass this `Database` explicitly to `transaction(db) { }` — a bare `transaction { }`
 * resolves to whichever `Database` registered *first* process-wide, not necessarily
 * this one.
 *
 * `preserveKeywordCasing` defaults to `true`, which makes Exposed double-quote any
 * column name that collides with a SQL:2003 reserved word (our `state` column is
 * one) so its exact case survives. Flyway's `CREATE TABLE` left that column
 * unquoted, so H2 folded it to `STATE`; a later quoted `"state"` reference then
 * misses it entirely ("Column REQUEST.state not found"). Disabling the flag keeps
 * Exposed's identifier handling on the same unquoted, case-folded footing Flyway's
 * raw SQL already established.
 *
 * `defaultMaxAttempts` defaults to `3`, which would silently retry a whole
 * transaction body on `SQLException` where the hand-rolled JDBC this replaced
 * propagated on the first failure. Set to `1` to preserve that behaviour exactly —
 * this port changes no behaviour, and a retry policy is a behaviour.
